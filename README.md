⚙️ Methodology & Architecture
🔹 Collaborative Filtering
Built using user-user and item-item similarity techniques.

Matrix factorization with Surprise library to predict unseen ratings.

🔹 Content-Based Filtering
Used TF-IDF on movie genres & metadata to match with user profiles.

Personalized recommendations based on user history and preferences.

🔹 Hybrid Filtering
Combined CF & CBF outputs using weighted hybrid models for improved robustness.

Resolved cold start and sparsity issues.

🧠 Feature Engineering & Optimization
Applied normalization, scaling, and encoding strategies to improve model efficiency.

Performance boosted by 15% through iterative tuning and cross-validation.

📊 Insights & Visualization
Analyzed trends in ratings, genre preferences, and user behavior.

Visualized key data using matplotlib and seaborn.
